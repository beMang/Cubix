# Cubix - A simple 3D engine

For now we can just render vertices with some edge but the goal is to implement more feature.

## Features implemented

* Rendering vertices and edges
* Camera and world transform

## Features that I would like to implement

* Face rendering
* Texture mapping
* .obj files loading
* Z-buffer
* Clipping to optimise the thing
* Some basic lighting
