# Cubix - A simple 3D engine

For now we can just render vertices with some edge but the goal is to implement more feature.

## Features implemented

* Rendering vertices and edges
* Camera and world transform

## Features that I would like to implement

* work with faces instead of vertices
* implement face culling
* Face rendering
* Some basic lighting for face
* .obj files loading
* Texture mapping
* Z-buffer
* Clipping to optimise the thing

## TRANSLATION FROM C TO CPP :
* Object => general meaning for any object in a scene
* camera herit from object class (position and rotation have the same meaning)
* mesh herit from object class !
